## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) to convey the high-energy, technological aspect of racing.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2B2B2B) provides contrast and focuses user attention on essential race data.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFFF00) is used for warnings and crucial alerts, capitalizing on its attention-grabbing properties. It stands out against the dark background, and its analogous relationship to blue preserves design unity.
- Use a clear, sans-serif font for all data displays to ensure legibility at a glance.
- Incorporate a set of consistent icons for different alerts (fuel, driver change) to offer easy recognition.
- The layout should prioritize real-time data with the most crucial timers and alerts prominently displayed.
- Use smooth transitions and subtle animations to provide feedback without distracting from the essential information during a race.
